# Interesting Article on [What a College Degree in Software Engineering Doesnâ€™t Prepare You For](https://betterprogramming.pub/what-a-college-degree-in-software-engineering-does-not-prepare-you-for-7f6d1f156f0a)

It was interesting that the article offers the distinctions between college and industry through the author's own experiences. He stated that the stakes are higher because code will be written for the company to be used by their clients. Although the cost of errors in writing code for a course in college will be our grades, any errors or bugs that were written for a company will cost a lot of money. 

Another interesting portion of the article is that deadlines can change. During college, the deadlines usually do not change; even if they do, it is usually an extension. However, in industry, deadlines may suddenly change, and you will have to end up rushing the project to meet deadlines.

Going into college, I did indeed have the naive belief that I will be taught everything that needs to be known in order to prepare for a job in the industry. Now that I am halfway through my academic journey, I can already anticipate the things that are listed in the article. One of the points mentioned in the article that I have come to accept about my college degree is that I will need to always be flexible to learn as I go, on the job. Nevertheless, the fact that this is the experience of most developers in the field helps reduces the stress of feeling inexperienced, induced by imposter syndrome.

This is definetly an article I wish I had seen before entering college. In high school, I thought that college was this "fantastical" realm where I would be able to find my passion and get me life on track. Throughout my time in college, I was in a fruitless cat-and-mouse chase of trying to figure what I wanted to do. I first started out in the premed track and quickly segwayed out of that and into computer science. But now having settled in a bit more comfortably in this field, I agree with this articles opinion that there are a lot of things that won't be taught in the workplace. To be honest, I am unsure as to whether this is something I want to do in the future. But at this point, I am a little bit more reluctant and just ride the wave as it pulls me along.

I have always struggled with the idea of my work in school playing out in the real world. Especially in high school, where it seemed like what I was learning in class was just preparing me for the next test, and would ultimately not be applied in any real world setting. Now in college, taking a course in software engineering, I expected to learn how a software development team operates, closely mimicking a real team performs on a day to day basis. However, after reading this article, I realized that even if the course prepared me in such a way, it still would not be able to prepare me for the actual job. No amount of college classes can truly prepare you for what a specific job will ask from you.
