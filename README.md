# Interesting Article on [What a College Degree in Software Engineering Doesn’t Prepare You For](https://betterprogramming.pub/what-a-college-degree-in-software-engineering-does-not-prepare-you-for-7f6d1f156f0a)

It was interesting that the article offers the distinctions between college and industry through the author's own experiences. He stated that the stakes are higher because code will be written for the company to be used by their clients. Although the cost of errors in writing code for a course in college will be our grades, any errors or bugs that were written for a company will cost a lot of money. 

Another interesting portion of the article is that deadlines can change. During college, the deadlines usually do not change; even if they do, it is usually an extension. However, in industry, deadlines may suddenly change, and you will have to end up rushing the project to meet deadlines.

Going into college, I did indeed have the naive belief that I will be taught everything that needs to be known in order to prepare for a job in the industry. Now that I am halfway through my academic journey, I can already anticipate the things that are listed in the article. One of the points mentioned in the article that I have come to accept about my college degree is that I will need to always be flexible to learn as I go, on the job. Nevertheless, the fact that this is the experience of most developers in the field helps reduces the stress of feeling inexperienced, induced by imposter syndrome.
